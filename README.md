# Brain-Tumour-Detection

BRAIN TUMOUR DATASET INFO :

This brain tumour dataset contains 3064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images
from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumour: meningioma (708 slices),
glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumour (930 slices). Due to the file size
limit of repository, the whole dataset is split into 4 subsets, and archive
them in 4 .zip files with each .zip file containing 766 slices.The 5-fold
cross-validation indices are also provided.

-----
This data is organized in matlab data format (.mat file). Each file stores a struct
containing the following fields for an image:

cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumour
cjdata.PID: patient ID
cjdata.image: image data
cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumour border.
		For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumour border.
		It was generated by manually delineating the tumour border. So we can use it to generate
		binary image of tumour mask.
cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumour region
